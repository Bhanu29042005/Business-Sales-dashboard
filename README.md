## 5️⃣ Features and Highlights  

### 🧩 Business Problem  
Sales performance was inconsistent across regions, and leadership lacked visibility into profit-driving vs. loss-generating markets, customers, and products. There was no unified view for decision-makers to compare trends or set performance targets.

### 🎯 Why This Dashboard Was Built  
To solve the above problem by creating a centralized, easy-to-use, and interactive dashboard that highlights:
- Which **markets** are performing well or underperforming  
- Who the **top customers and products** are  
- How **profit margins** behave over time and location  
- Where revenue losses are occurring and why
